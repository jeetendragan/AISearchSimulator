This project started off with the implementation of various search algorithms, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. Some areas that I wish to work on(or have contributors to work on) are - 
- Adding more graph/tree algorithms
- Adding more features like showing pseudocode for the selected algorithm, etc.

Currently the project has the following algorithm categories and sub-categories
- Search Algorithms
  - Breadth First Search
  - Depth First Search
  - Uniform Cost Search
  - A* Search
  - Depth First Optimal
  - Best fit Search
- Other graph algorithms
  - Bipartite Graph Checker
  - Topological sorting
  
Other algorithms that can be added
- Graph coloring
- Connected components
- Finding bridges in a graph
- ~~Topological sorting~~
- Maximum flow
- and a lot more....

Looking forward to your contributions.

# Why should you contribute?
I think you get to build some important skills through the project
- Algorithms - Since you are implementing algorithms, you are bound to improve your algorithmic skills.
- Software engineering skills
  - You will not be implementing algorithms that are de-coupled. All the algorithms use the currently implemented functionalities. When a new algorithm needs to be implemented, some old decision has to be undone to allow an easier implementation of the current algorithm. But this may change implementations of various other algorithms. Reconsidering design decisions when a new feature is to be added is what makes software building fun.
  
# AISearchSimulator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

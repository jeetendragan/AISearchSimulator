This project started with the implementation of various search algorithms, but I wish to extend and add a lot more graph algorithms to the project. I think there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of ad. Some more features like showing the pseudocode can enhance the project. Looking forward to your contributions.

This project started with the implementation of various search algorithms, but there is still a lot of improvement. Some areas that I wish to work on(or have contributors to work on) are
- Adding more algorithms
- Adding more features like showing pseudocode for the selected algorithm, etc.

Looking forward to your contrinutions.

# Run the project

Here is the link to the project(https://ai-search-simulator.herokuapp.com)

# AISearchSimulator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

## Development server
